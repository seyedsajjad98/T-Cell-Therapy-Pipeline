# Computational T Cell Therapy Pipeline

**A conceptual pipeline for designing and simulating gene perturbations in T cell therapy research.**

## Project Overview

This project outlines a streamlined pipeline to assist T cell therapy researchers in designing, simulating, and optimizing gene perturbations for enhanced therapeutic outcomes. The pipeline integrates various tools and databases to translate functional goals and experimental tools into actionable gene sets, leveraging predictive modeling and enrichment analysis to generate comprehensive reports.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Conceptual Design
- **Progress:** Extensive research and design proposal completed. Implementation and data integration are planned as part of my ongoing Master’s Thesis under the supervision of Dr. Lagani.
- **Future Plans:** Expansion to iPSC differentiation models and potential commercialization through integration with biotech companies or startups.

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **User Input:** Define T cell therapy objectives (functional goals) and planned interventions (experimental tools).
2. **Gene Set Compilation:** Translate user inputs into GEARS-compatible gene sets using curated databases.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize GEARS to simulate transcriptomic changes based on gene perturbations.
4. **Enrichment Analysis:** Apply DOSE for pathway and disease enrichment analysis on GEARS results.
5. **Report Generation:** Consolidate findings into a comprehensive, context-rich report tailored to the researcher’s aims.

## Key Components

- **GEARS:** Predictive modeling tool for simulating transcriptomic changes.
- **DOSE:** Pathway and disease enrichment analysis.
- **Databases:** ImmPort, TISIDB, DICE, MSigDB, and others for gene set curation.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Finalize gene set curation methods.
- **Phase 2:** Integrate DOSE with GEARS outputs.
- **Phase 3:** Develop custom reporting framework.
- **Phase 4:** Prototype development and testing.
